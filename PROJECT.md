# 🚀 Cassini-Huygens MCP Server Project Plan

## 📋 Project Overview
Building an MCP server using Node.js, Express, and SQLite3 to serve mission plan data from the Cassini-Huygens space mission.

**Database**: `data/master_plan.db` (already created)

---

## 🔄 Iteration 1: Project Foundation & Database Schema
**Goal**: Set up the basic project structure and understand the database schema

### ✅ Tasks
- [x] Initialize Node.js project with Express
- [x] Install required dependencies (express, sqlite3, etc.)
- [x] Examine database schema in `data/master_plan.db`
- [x] Document database tables and relationships
- [x] Create basic Express server skeleton
- [x] Set up project directory structure (`lib/models`, `lib/services`)

---

## 🔄 Iteration 2: Data Models & Database Connection
**Goal**: Create model classes and establish database connectivity

### ✅ Tasks
- [x] Create database connection service in `lib/services`
- [x] Build model classes in `lib/models` for each table
- [x] Add proper TypeScript/JSDoc types to models
- [x] Implement basic CRUD methods for models
- [x] Test database connectivity
- [x] Document model interfaces and methods

---

## 🔄 Iteration 3: Core API Endpoints
**Goal**: Implement RESTful API endpoints for mission data access

### ✅ Tasks
- [x] Design API endpoint structure
- [x] Create route handlers for mission data
- [x] Implement GET endpoints for reading data
- [x] Add request validation
- [x] Implement error handling middleware
- [x] Document API endpoints

---

## 🔄 Iteration 4: MCP Protocol Integration
**Goal**: Integrate MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Research and implement MCP protocol requirements
- [ ] Add MCP-specific endpoints
- [ ] Implement resource discovery
- [ ] Add prompt templates for mission data
- [ ] Test MCP client integration
- [ ] Document MCP capabilities

---

## 🔄 Iteration 5: Testing, Documentation & Deployment
**Goal**: Finalize the server with tests, documentation, and deployment prep

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for models and services
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Prepare deployment configuration
- [ ] Final code review and cleanup

---

## 📝 Notes
- Each task represents a single git commit
- Each iteration represents a single push to Github dev branch
- Never edit `package.json` directly - always use `npm install`
- All models go in `lib/models`, all services go in `lib/services`
- No generic utility code allowed

# The Cassini MCP Server with Node.js

We're going to dive in to the world of Model Context Protocol (MCP)

We're also going to do this with Claude code. Firstly, working out what it is and secondly - building one

## Agenda

- Ask what an MCP server is and why we should care

- Go through the data we want to use with our new server

- Review the instructions and `docs`

- Create the project plan, using 5 iterations

- Audit logs, to keep the receipts for the AI code we generate

- Generate things one at a time, using tests
